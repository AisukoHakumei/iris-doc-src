# Tasks

Tasks allow incident handlers to split the workload into unit tasks, and to assign them to the team members.

## Add a task

A task can be created by going to `Case` > `Tasks`. Clicking on `Add Task` in the top right corner brings up a new window for the task creation.

## Comment a task

Tasks can be commented. This provide the ability for analysts to give more in-deepth information on the task execution (what did they do, how did they do, what are the results, etc.)
