# Notes

!!! attention
    The notes layout has been updated in IRIS 2.4.0. The following documentation is valid for IRIS 2.4.0 and above.

IRIS allows analysts to add notes to cases. Notes can be added to a case from the `Notes` tab.  
Notes are organized by directories. A note has to live within a directory. 

## Adding a directory
To add a directory, click on the `+` directory icon on the left side of the `Notes` tab. A new directory is added to the list and asks for a name.
