## What's IRIS ?
In a nutshell, IRIS is a collaborative platform for incident response analysts that helps to share investigations at a technical level.  
It's web application, so it can be either installed on a fixed-server, or on a laptop for roaming investigations where internet might not be available. 

It is born following the struggle to share long and complex investigations among analysts. 

The project is available on our [Github organisation](https://github.com/dfir-iris)

!!! warning "Disclaimer"

    IRIS is still in its early stage. It can already be used in production, but please [set backups of the database](/operations/upgrades/#backing-up-db) and DO NOT expose the interface on the Internet.
    We highly recommended the use of a private dedicated and secured network.
