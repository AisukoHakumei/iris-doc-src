!!! hint  "**New to IRIS ?** [This is where you can start.](/getting_started/)"

This documentation is in constant evolution, so if you don't find what you are looking for, you can come back later or even better [contact us](/contact) so we can add the missing piece. 


## What's IRIS ?
In a nutshell, IRIS is a collaborative platform for incident response analysts that helps to share investigations at a technical level.  
It's web application, so it can be either installed on a fixed-server, or on a laptop for roaming investigations where internet might not be available. 

It is born following the struggle to share long and complex investigations among analysts. 

The project is available on our [Github organisation](https://github.com/dfir-iris)

!!! warning "Disclaimer"

    IRIS is in its early stage. It can already be used in production, but please [set backups of the database](/operations/upgrades/#backing-up-db) and DO NOT expose the interface on the Internet.
    We highly recommended the use of a private dedicated and secured network. 

<!-- !!! warning "Upgrading to v1.4.0 ? Please read the [upgrade documentation](/operations/upgrades/#v140)" -->
