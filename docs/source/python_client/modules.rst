Python client
=============

`dfir_iris_client` offers a Python interface to communicate with IRIS.  

It relies exclusively on the API, which means output of the methods are the same as specified in the API reference. 

Versions
--------
The Python client version follows the API versions (until the patch level). Meaning for API v1.0.1, one need to install `dfir_iris_client-1.0.1`. 


Examples
--------
Some examples are available `See here <https://github.com/dfir-iris/iris-client/templates>`_
