!!! warning "Note of 25-05-2023"
    IRIS is growing both in code and interestes. To future-proof the project, we have decided to pause the development of new features and focus on the core functionalities and stability for a while.  
    This includes a major refactoring of the codebase. We will still fix bugs and security issues.

<p style="text-align: center;" markdown>We do not provide a long-term roadmap to prevent any frustration and unmet expectations.
It is constantly evolving with feedbacks we receive.</p><p style="text-align: center;" markdown>
We've thus moved it within a Github project. You can check it [here](https://github.com/orgs/dfir-iris/projects/1).</p>
